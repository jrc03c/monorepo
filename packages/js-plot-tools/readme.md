# Usage

Node:

```js
const { Plotter } = require("@jrc03c/js-plot-tools")
const { range, pow } = require("@jrc03c/js-math-tools")
const plot = new Plotter()
const x = range(-1, 1, 0.01)
const y = pow(x, 3)
plot.line(x, y)
plot.show()
```

Browser:

```html
<div id="plot"></div>
<script src="path/to/dist/js-plot-tools.js"></script>
<script src="path/to/dist/js-math-tools.js"></script>
<script>
  const { sin, normal } = JSMathTools

# API

## `AbstractPlotter`

This is an abstract class whose `.show()` method must be overridden in a subclass. Both the `NodePlotter` and `BrowserPlotter` classes extend this class.

### Properties

#### `.instructions`

The list of drawing instructions.

#### `.shouldDrawAxes`

A boolean indicating whether or not axes should be drawn. If `false`, then tick marks will not be drawn either, even if `.shouldDrawTickMarks` is set to `true`. It's `true` by default.

#### `.shouldDrawTickMarks`

A boolean indicating whether or not tick marks should be drawn on the axes. Currently, tick marks are calculated automatically and cannot be set manually. It's `true` by default.

#### `.shouldSetBoundsAutomatically`

A boolean indicating whether or not display bounds should be computed automatically. It's `true` by default.

#### `.padding`

The number of pixels around the drawing in the canvas.

### Methods

#### `.clear()`

Clears the `.instructions` list.

#### `.dehydrate()`

Returns a stringified version of the `NodePlotter` instance.

#### `.setBounds(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)`

Sets the display bounds of the plot.

#### `.scatter(x, y)`

Adds a scatter plot to the list of drawing instructions given one-dimensional lists of _x_- and _y_-values.

#### `.line(x, y)`

Adds a line plot to the list of drawing instructions given one-dimensional lists of _x_- and _y_-values.

#### `.hist(x, bins=20)`

Adds a histogram to the list of drawing instructions given a one-dimensional list of _x_-values.

#### `.show()`

This function will throw an error. It must be overridden in a subclass.

## `NodePlotter` (extends `AbstractPlotter`)

This is the class that's used in Node. When you import the library from Node, the class will just be called `Plotter`, but you can import this class directly if you want to, like this:

```js
const { NodePlotter } = require("@jrc03c/js-plot-tools/src/node-plotter.js")
const plot = new NodePlotter()
// ...
```

More often, though, you'll import either the `Plotter` class (which is just a renamed `NodePlotter` class) or the `plot` object (which is an instance of the `Plotter` class), like:

```js
const { plot, Plotter } = require("@jrc03c/js-plot-tools")
```

### Properties

#### `.browserCommand`

The `browserCommand` is the thing that will be run when you call `plot.show()` on a `NodePlotter` object. By default, it's `"xdg-open $FILE"`, which means that the operating system will be asked to use its default tool for handling HTML files. But if you wanted to set the command to something more specific (e.g., to have the file opened specifically with Firefox), you could do this:

```js
const { NodePlotter } = require("@jrc03c/js-plot-tools/src/node-plotter.js")
const plot = new NodePlotter()
plot.browserCommand = "firefox $FILE"
```

You don't need to replace `$FILE` yourself; it's automatically replaced with the path of the HTML file that the plotter generates.

### Methods

#### `.show()`

Overrides the `AbstractPlotter.show()` method. It dumps the dehydrated copy of itself and a copy of the library into an HTML file and opens that file in the OS's default browser. At that point, the `BrowserPlotter` class will automatically take over and actually execute the drawing instructions.

### Examples

```js
const { plot } = require("@jrc03c/js-plot-tools")
const { range, sin } = require("@jrc03c/js-math-tools")
const x = range(-Math.PI * 2, Math.PI * 2, 0.01)
const y = sin(x)
plot.line(x, y)
plot.show()
```

## `BrowserPlotter` (extends `AbstractPlotter`)

This is the class that's used in the browser. When you load the library in the browser, the class will just be called `Plotter` and will be globally available. Also, a global `plot` object will be available in the browser. The former is useful for when you want multiple plots on the same page; the latter is useful if you just want to draw on the entire page. The constructor optionally accepts an `HTMLElement` or a selector string; if no argument is passed, then `document.body` will be used.

### Properties

#### `.element`

The `HTMLElement` that was specified by the constructor argument.

#### `.left`

Defines the left-most possible value to be drawn on the _x_-axis. By default, it's -1. It can either be assigned manually or set via the `setBounds(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)` method.

#### `.right`

Defines the right-most possible value to be drawn on the _x_-axis. By default, it's 1. It can either be assigned manually or set via the `setBounds(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)` method.

#### `.bottom`

Defines the bottom-most possible value to be drawn on the _y_-axis. By default, it's -1. It can either be assigned manually or set via the `setBounds(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)` method.

#### `.top`

Defines the top-most possible value to be drawn on the _y_-axis. By default, it's 1. It can either be assigned manually or set via the `setBounds(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)` method.

### Methods

#### `.hydrate(obj)` [static]

This static method returns a `BrowserPlotter` given a previously dehydrated plotter instance. For example (in the browser):

```js
const plot1 = new Plotter()
const plot2 = Plotter.hydrate(plot1.dehydrate())
```

Normally, though, you wouldn't dehydrate a `BrowserPlotter` instance and then rehydrate it. Instead, the usual workflow is that you'd dehydrate a `NodePlotter` instance, save that stringified data somewhere, load that data into the browser, and then use `Plotter.hydrate(obj)` (keeping in mind that `BrowserPlotter` is just called `Plotter` in the browser!) to return a plotter instance that has the same properties as the `NodePlotter` instance.

To clarify, you don't have to use both `NodePlotter` and `BrowserPlotter` in conjunction; they can be used independently of each other (though, of course, `NodePlotter` secretly relies on `BrowserPlotter`).

#### `.show()`

Overrides the `AbstractPlotter.show()` method. It executes all of the instructions in the `.instructions` list.

There's an important thing to keep in mind here: the dimensions of the plot will match the dimensions of `.element`, which will be retrieved when `.show()` is called. If `.element` represents an empty, unstyled element, then your plot may end up having a height of 0, in which case it won't be visible. The solution is to give `.element` some width and height via CSS _before_ calling the `.show()` method.

### Examples

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <style>
      #plot {
        width: 640px;
        height: 480px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="plot"></div>

    <script src="path/to/dist/js-plot-tools.js"></script>
    <script src="path/to/dist/js-math-tools.js"></script>
    <script>
      const { range, sin } = JSMathTools
      const plot = new Plotter("#plot")
      const x = range(-Math.PI * 2, Math.PI * 2, 0.01)
      const y = sin(x)
      plot.line(x, y)
      plot.show()
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
